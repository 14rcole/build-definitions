# build-definitions

This directory the OCI bundle with default pipelines installed for build-definitions.

In `package-bundle.sh` set this to the correct version.  

Currently set manually (v0.1, v0.1.1), but when integrated into a CI, will shift to use git commit SHA. 

This have to be updated on the infra-deployment cluster when the version is updated.

TODO - add CI automate this version bumps.
